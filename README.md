# iCoder Website
  This Project represents the structure of a website for a fictional company called "iCoder". It's built using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework for responsive web design.  Here's a brief overview of the project:

Navbar: The website includes a navigation bar with links to Home, About, Contact, and a Dropdown menu. It also features a search form and buttons for login and signup, which trigger modal pop-ups.

Modals: There are two modals implemented - one for user login and the other for user signup. Each modal contains input fields for email, password, and other relevant information.

Carousel: The homepage showcases a carousel slider with three slides, each featuring an image, a title, and a brief description. There are also buttons within the slides for additional interaction.

Featurettes: Below the carousel, there are three featurette sections, each consisting of an image and accompanying text. These sections highlight key features or aspects of the company.

Bootstrap Integration: Throughout the code, Bootstrap classes are used extensively for styling and layout purposes. This ensures the website is responsive and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for a professional and visually appealing website, leveraging the power of Bootstrap for seamless design and functionality.
